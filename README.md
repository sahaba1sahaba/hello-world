SipDemo troubleshooting

I am a solution architect in one of leading Telecomm Company for IMS Netowork. I am using SipDemo example from Android Developers in Android Studio to connect to IMS / SBC / P-CSCF on SIP Protocol. Objective: build Telco-OTT app having communication features (e.g. voice/sms etc.) , similar to non-Telco-OTT app like SKYPE/VIBER/FB etc.
